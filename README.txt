--------------------------GETING STARTED-------------------------------
Current versions of Project Narwhal are coded, compiled and run through
IntelleJ IDEA. The project can be manually compiled and run, however
correct dependencies found in the ProjectNarwhal/README.txt will need
to be manually added. 

To open the project, open the ProjectNarwhal directory in Intellij IDEA.
CRITICAL: DO NOT OPEN THE GIT ROOT DIRECTORY "group-project-narwhals".
This will result in the project being unable to compile or run due to
how the ProjectNarwhal.iml file functions.

The follow the instructions in the ProjectNarwhal/README.txt to install
dependencies. These libraries will need to be need to be installed
individually. Selecting multiple at once and importing them will result
in the existing IML file no longer working and changes to the IML file
on the main brach of git will break the project for all other users.
